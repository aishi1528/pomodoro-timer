# Pomodoro Timer ⏳

A simple Pomodoro timer made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can set your own session length, start the timer, pause if needed, and reset whenever you want. Just something I built for staying focused while studying or working.

## How it works

- You can set any time between 1 to 120 minutes.
- Once you click "Start", the countdown begins.
- You can pause and resume it any time.
- Hitting "Reset" will stop the timer and let you change the time again.
- A small reminder is shown to reset the timer after changing the time input.

## Why I made this

Just wanted a lightweight timer without distractions. Plus, I thought this would be a good mini project.
